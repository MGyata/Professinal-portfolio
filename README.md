# Professinal-Portfolio

-When the portfolio is loaded I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to reach them.

-When I click one the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

-When I click on the images of the applications I am taken to that deployed application

-When I resize the page or view the site on different screens and devices I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my screen
